This project is a few bash scripts I wrote for doing forensics things. 
This began with a presentation I gave in October 2022 which consisted of redoing some Python scripts to
be in bash instead with some pretty impressive results.

In November 2022 I added a presentation for a three-hour workshop along with a few more scripts.  

There may be more additions in the future.
